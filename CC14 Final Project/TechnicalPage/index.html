            Web application development stands at the forefront of modern technological innovation, shaping the digital landscape in profound ways. As graduating from this course delving into the intricacies of this field, 
            I find myself reflecting on the journey thus far, contemplating the evolution, challenges, and future prospects of web application development.
          </p>

          <p>
            The evolution of web application development traces a narrative of relentless innovation and adaptation. From the rudimentary HTML pages of the early internet to the sophisticated, 
            immersive applications of today, the trajectory has been propelled by a relentless quest for improvement, driven by advancements in technology, shifts in user expectations, and the dynamic landscape of the digital economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, beneath the surface of technological progress lies a rich tapestry of human experience and endeavor. Web application development is not merely about lines of code or algorithms; it is a manifestation of human creativity, collaboration, and ingenuity. It is a discipline that bridges 
            the gap between art and science, where aesthetic design meets functional utility, and where user experience takes precedence over mere functionality.

          <p>In the expansive realm of modern web development, HTML stands as the cornerstone of the digital landscape, comprehending the essence and intricacies of HTML is paramount. 
             Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, serves as the fundamental language for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
             Its significance lies not only in its foundational role but also in its continuous evolution and adaptation to the dynamic demands of the digital era.
             As we delve into the essence of HTML, it becomes apparent that its significance extends far beyond mere syntax and semantics. HTML embodies the core principles of accessibility, 
             interoperability, and scalability, making it indispensable for web developers, designers, and enthusiasts alike. Its simplicity belies its power, 
             providing a structured framework upon which the myriad elements of the web are built and interconnected.</p>

          Sample HTML code:
          <code>
            !DOCTYPE html
            html
            head
            title Page Title /title

            p paragraph. /p
            
            /body
            /html 

          </code>
          <ul>
            <li>The "!DOCTYPE html" declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</li>
            <li>The "html" element is the root element of an HTML page</li>
            <li>The "head" element contains meta information about the HTML page</li>
            <li>The "title" element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)</li>
            <li>The "body" element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</li>
            <li>The "h1-h6" element defines a large heading</li>
            <li>The "p" element defines a paragraph</li>
          </ul>
          Some basic commands in HTML:
            <li>"hr" Defines a thematic change in the content</li>
            <li>"!--...--" Defines a comment</li>
            <li>"br" breaks content</li>

          CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful language used to style the presentation of HTML documents. While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS allows you to control how that content is displayed on the screen.
          With CSS, you can define styles for various elements of your HTML document, such as fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and more. By separating the content from its presentation, CSS promotes cleaner code, easier maintenance, and greater flexibility in design.

        <h2>Types of CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS <br> - Inline CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. <br> - Styles defined inline override any external or internal CSS rules.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS <br> - Internal CSS is placed within the "style" element in the "head" section of an HTML document. <br> - Styles defined internally apply to the entire document.</li>
          <li>External CSS <br> - External CSS is stored in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents using the "link" element. <br> - Allows for better organization and reusability of styles across multiple pages.</li>

          You can declare a variable in three ways:
          <p>
            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
          <p>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>

          <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y isnot defined</code>
